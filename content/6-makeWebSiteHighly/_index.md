#### Create High Availability 2-tier Web Application

In today's digital landscape, ensuring the availability and reliability of web applications is crucial to meet user expectations and maintain business continuity. With the emergence of cloud computing, platforms such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) provide robust infrastructure and services to achieve high availability and fault tolerance.

A two-tier web application architecture with high availability on AWS demonstrates flexibility, scalability, and performance optimization. This architecture consists of two separate tiers: the presentation tier responsible for serving user requests, and the data tier managing application data storage and retrieval. Using AWS services, this architecture ensures continuous operation, seamless scalability, and efficient resource utilization.

In the presentation tier, web servers are hosted on Amazon EC2 instances distributed across multiple available zones (AZs) for fault tolerance. These instances are configured in an auto-scaling group, automatically adjusting capacity to match fluctuating traffic demands. A Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) distributes request traffic to healthy instances, ensuring optimal performance and minimizing single points of failure.

Concurrently, the data tier relies on Amazon RDS, a managed relational database service, providing scalability, automatic backups, and multi-region deployment options. By replicating data across regions, RDS enhances fault tolerance and data durability, minimizing downtime and data loss in case of incidents.

The coordination of these components in a two-tier high availability architecture on AWS promotes resilience against hardware failures, network issues, and regional outages. Additionally, AWS CloudWatch provides comprehensive monitoring and alerting capabilities, enabling proactive management of system health and performance metrics.

In summary, a two-tier web application architecture with high availability on AWS epitomizes modern cloud-native principles, enabling businesses to deliver seamless user experiences while maintaining operational excellence. By leveraging scalable infrastructure and reliable services from AWS, organizations can achieve reliability, flexibility, and unlimited scalability in the digital age.

Below is a simple explanation of deploying a two-tier web application architecture on the AWS infrastructure.
